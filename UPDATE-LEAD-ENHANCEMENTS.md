---

## How It Works Now

### When You Update a Lead:

**Step 1:** Go to All Leads or Quick Actions â†’ Update Lead Status

**Step 2:** Select a lead and update:
- New Status/Stage (e.g., "Sales Pitch Meeting")
- Lead Temperature (Cold/Warm/Hot)
- Activity Notes
- Next Steps (e.g., "Follow up next week")

**Step 3:** Submit the update

### What Happens:

âœ… **Lead card updates** to show:
- Current stage: "Sales Pitch Meeting"
- Next steps box: "ðŸ“Œ Next Steps: Timothy Asprec will Follow up next week"
- Last Contact: "Today"

âœ… **Activity Feed logs**:
- "Timothy Asprec moved [Contact] - [Company] from [Old Stage] to [New Stage]"

âœ… **Database stores**:
- `stage`: Current pipeline stage
- `lead_temperature`: Hot/Warm/Cold
- `next_steps`: Action items (stored separately)
- `notes`: Historical activity notes with timestamps
