# Builder Update Tracking & Activity Feed Improvements

## Overview
This update fixes the builder card status display, adds comprehensive update history tracking for job search status changes, and enhances the Activity Feed to show all builder updates with celebration messages.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Status Badge Centering
**Problem:** Status badges on builder cards were not properly centered and aligned.

**Solution:**
- Updated `.builders__status-badge` CSS to include:
  - `display: inline-flex`
  - `align-items: center`
  - `justify-content: center`
  - Increased padding from `0.25rem 0.75rem` to `0.375rem 0.875rem`
  - Increased font-weight to 600 for better readability

### 2. ✅ Job Search Status Update History
**Problem:** When updating a builder's Job Search Status (e.g., from "Building Resume" to "Interviewing"), the change was not being recorded in the Update History.

**Solution:**
- Modified `handleUpdateBuilder` function in `Builders.jsx` to:
  - Track job search status changes with human-readable labels
  - Record old status → new status transitions
  - Track offer details (company name, salary) when entered
  - Add all changes to the notes field with timestamps
  - Include job status in activity feed details

**Example Update History Entry:**
```
[10/14/2025] Updated: job status from "Building Resume" to "Interviewing"
```

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Activity Feed Updates
**Problem:** Activity Feed was not showing detailed information about builder updates, making it hard to track progress.

**Solution:**

#### Enhanced Message Display:
- **Before:** "updated Jack Sparrow"
- **After:** "updated Jack Sparrow's job status from 'Building Resume' to 'Interviewing'" with status badge

#### Added Dynamic Emojis:
- 🎉 Hired/Placed
- 💼 Offer/Negotiation  
- 🗣️ Interviewing
- 📝 Actively Applying
- 📊 General updates
- ✅ Completed tasks

#### Added Celebration Messages:
- **Hired/Placed:** "Congratulations! Builder successfully placed! 🎉🎊"
- **Offer/Negotiation:** "Offer received! Almost there! 🎯"
- **Interviewing:** "Interviews in progress! Keep it up! 💪"
- **Tasks Completed:** "Task completed! Great progress! ✨"

## How It Works Now

### When You Update a Builder:

1. **Edit Builder Profile**

   - Job search status changes (with before/after labels)
   - Offer details (company name, salary amounts)
4. **Update History populated**:
   - Timestamped entry added to builder's notes
   - Shows exactly what changed
5. **Activity Feed updated**:
   - Creates activity entry with section badge
   - Shows detailed change information
   - Displays current job status as a badge
