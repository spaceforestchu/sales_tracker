Sales outreach tracker   
Launch date 10/22

**Problem:**  
Pursuit staff members are exploring many different avenues to secure jobs for our Builders (jobs \= \#1 priority). Salesforce is too clunky, not set-up for non-traditional pipeline activity, and makes it difficult to manage staff members against. 

**Goals and objectives:**  
Set-up an easy to use, lightweight CRM to track staff-driven sales outreach / job leads. It should:

- Be easy and extremely low friction for staff members to use  
- Account for the different types of job sourcing / outreach that staff members are conducting  
- Allow leadership team members and PBC team members to easily view / sort / filter activity across the org   
  That 

**Target audience:**

- All staff members: input and update ‘leads’ \- including potential employers \+ relevant job postings   
- Admins (leadership team \+ PBC): view / sort / filter org-wide activity to manage staff against, strategize follow-up, abstract learnings

**Use cases:**

- Staff members: input outreach efforts \+ responses, log relevant job postings   
- Leadership team: manage staff members against (e.g., understand which staff members are driving activity and partner w/ staff members who are not engaged to understand how to unblock), abstract trends / learnings   
- PBC team: manage follow-up / hand-offs based on interested leads, adjust sales strategy based on trends / learnings   
- Delivery team: share job postings with relevant Builders 

**Requirements:**

- Each staff member can log-in:  
  - Input new outreach attempts / relevant job postings   
  - View and edit past outreach attempts / job postings (e.g., log responses / change pipeline status, etc.)   
- Admins can log-in:  
  - See and edit all staff member outreach, pipeline status and notes  
  - See all staff member-sourced job postings    
- Database is built in a way that will allow future tool integration 

**Success metrics:**

- 100% staff participation in sales outreach / job sourcing  
- 100% tracking of sales outreach / job sourcing ‘activity’   
- Easy mechanism to identify trends / learnings as we build out the AI Native ‘job machine’   
- Ultimately… 34/34 Builder jobs ASAP

**Release Criteria:**

- Staff members can log-in, log, view and edit outreach attempts \+ job postings  
- Admins can log-in, view and edit all outreach attempts \+ job postings   
- *Note: I have some scraping functionality which I would like integrated (e.g., scraping name, company, role from a LinkedIn URL, or company and role from a job posting) \- but we can launch without the scraping capability if it proves too difficult to launch with*

**Out of Scope:**

- Connect w/ Salesforce (future feature)  
  - Will allow automated creation of opportunities in SF   
- Connect w/ AI Native tool (future feature)   
  - Will allow us to connect job applications to job postings

**Open Questions:**

- Do we want to build along two defined ‘pathways’ (e.g., contact outreach vs. job posting) or do we want to build in a more ‘open-ended way’ that captures all types of potential leads / jobs sources (and define pathways later based on what data emerges)?

**Future considerations:**

- Connectivity with AI Native tool \+ Salesforce
